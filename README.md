## Task Describtion

```
The Marketing agency "Horesion" asked to refactor its existing website to make it more accessible without changing its functionality. The code needed to be improved to meet a certain set of standards, especially to make it more accessible.  
To meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) the code has been improved so people with disabilities can access the website using assistive technologies. 

The goal is to avoid litigation and to optimize for search engines.
