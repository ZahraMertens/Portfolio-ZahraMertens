## Task Describtion

As a potential employer I want to get an impression of the developer to see project examples and contact information.

The portfolio is supposed to showcase the web developers skills and work that a potential employer or any other user can get an impression of the developers knowledge and qualifications. 


## Actual Behaviour

* WHEN the page loads, the user can see the hero image, a header with a navigation bar and the about-me section.

* WHEN I scrole down, the user can see examples of my work with the featured first project and a contact form to send an email to request a project.

* WHEN I see the footer, it includes possible contact information/ different links to social media platforms of the developer.

* When I click on the featured image of the first Project (CocktailHub), a new tab will open which takes you straight to the deployed webpage. 

* If the user clicks on the green button, a new tab will take the user to the GitHub repository.

* When I go to the slideshow and click on the arrows on the left or right, the user can slide through 5 project examples with a describtion. If the user clicks on the image, he/she will be taken to the deployed webpage and if clicked on the green button it will take you to the GitHub repository.

* WHEN the user goes to the last section of the page, he/she will be presented with a contact form to enter the name, email address and message to send an email to the developer. 

* WHEN the user goes to the footer of the page, he/she is able to go to different social media platforms of the web developer when clicked on the names of the SM platform.
